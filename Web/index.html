    this study course for a grade, but we do hope you will continue to participate
    throughout the entire quarter.

<h2>UPDATE (03/25/14):</h2>
<p>
<b>**New**</b> Please note that the course has moved time slightly, and now will take place from 12:30-2:00pm on Tuesdays. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by the change, unfortunately we were unable to secure an appropriate room at the originally scheduled time. The official course CRN is <a href="http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/courses/search/course_external.cfm?termCode=201403&crn=41091">41091</a>. We recommend enrolling for a total of 4 units, although if you need to enroll for more/less then you may do so. If you have trouble registering for the course then please contact <a href="mailto:agaribay@ucdavis.edu">Alejandra Garibay</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Enrollment Survey</h2>
For people considering participating in the course, we would
greatly appreciate ("require") you completing the
short <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/forms/d/1AegD1xZVfoVzp4PbLxaWIORLbLpbWj-WZwvOBDOKI7U/edit?usp=sharing">Google
Docs survey</a>.
This will help us determine how large a room we will need, what
background people have, etc.

</p>

<p>
This is an informal, group study style course.
The goal is to assemble an active group <i>doing</i> Data Science problems at UCD.
We hope to attract people (graduate students, postdocs, faculty,
and good undergraduates) from around the different departments,
etc. on campus who are interested in
    <ul>
       <li> analyzing interesting, complex and/or large data,
       <li> gaining experience using modern data technologies,
       <li> learning new statistical/machine learning approaches and methods,
       <li> implementing computational solutions and data analyses, and
       <li> creating compelling and insightful visualizations of information.
</p>    

<h2>Structure of the Explorations</h2>

<p>
We plan to focus the activities around 
two or more specific data analysis problems.
We will first introduce the sources of data that
we will be using and the general questions that are of interest,
together with the important issues and possible approaches to 
answering those questions.
Throughout each week we will work in groups on exploring the data and addressing the
questions, discussing issues on Piazza as they arise.
During each weekly meeting we will discuss some of the more
complex issues and introduce new statistical or computational
techniques as they become appropriate. These might include topics such as 
neural networks, deep learning and boosting on the statistical side,
MapReduce/Hadoop for parallel computing, or a particular R package or
Java library on the computational side. 
</p>

<p>
At the end of the quarter, groups will present their results. 
As extra incentive, we will give prizes to the best approaches in 
a variety of categories (e.g., best visualization, best interactive
application, best predictive performance).
</p>

<p>
We <b>strongly</b> encourage people who are facing Data Sciences challenges
in their research to come and present these to the group,
hopefully to educate each other, get suggestions as to how to solve
some of the challenges, and explore possibilities for accessing different
sources of data (e.g. Web scraping, APIs) or managing data.
We would love to hear about these and help out as is feasible.
</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>
The focus is on authentic data analysis and statistical
reasoning. Therefore, the focus is less on learning a predetermined
set of statistical techniques or computing technologies and instead
on using the most appropriate tools to address a given problem.
However, some of the topics we will use and/or introduce may include
<ul>
  <li> parallel computing (with any of: R, Python, MapReduce, Hadoop, C, GPUs)
  <li> statistical/machine learning techniques (e.g. boosting,
      bagging, classification trees, random forests, logistic
      regression, neural networks, deep learning).
  <li> visualization (static and interactive Web-based visualization)
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites/Background</h2>
In short, we want people who are motivated, interested, 
have initiative and some independence and who want to learn
more Data Science skills. You should
<ul>
  <li> have reasonable programming skills in a language such as R, Python,
        MATLAB, Java, C, C++ (it does not matter which language). 
  <li> have sufficient knowledge of statistics to understand heuristic
      descriptions of new methods (at the level of <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/">Introduction to  Statistical Learning with Applications in R</a>) if not the full technical details.
  <li> be willing to participate, speak up, explore data and write code.
</ul>
If you would like to participate but are unsure whether you have the 
appropriate programming and/or statistical skills then please feel free
to email <a href="mailto:dtemplelang@ucdavis.edu">Duncan</a> or
<a href="mailto:pdbaines@ucdavis.edu">Paul</a> directly.

<h2>Examples Data Problems</h2>
The datasets to be analyzed are still being finalized, but below are
some illustrative examples. If you know of a publicly available dataset
that you think would be interest then, again, please feel free to email 
<a href="mailto:dtemplelang@ucdavis.edu">Duncan</a> or
<a href="mailto:pdbaines@ucdavis.edu">Paul</a> with details. 
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Predicting race performance for runners using historical race
  results and (if available) training data.
  <dd> This involves data matching (across races) and 
  data fusion (across data sources) as well as flexible predictive 
  statistical techniques.
  <dt>
  <li> Image classification: classify each of a collection of pictures
   as either containing a dog or a cat.
  <dd> This task is very easy for humans to do, but is surprisingly challenging
  to automate. Approaches will involve some image processing as well as
      statistical/machine learning techniques for classification.
</dl>


<h2>Course Learning Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li> Enhance skills in how to map a question of interest into a statistical framework
and to identify and learn appropriate methods for estimation and
    prediction.
<li> Gain experience with computational techniques to explore, visualize and
    fit models with data.
</ul>
