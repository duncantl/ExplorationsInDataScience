Identify Data
Access Data
Understand format of Data
Clean data
Explore data  (iterate cleaning)
  Spend a lot of time becoming familiar with individual observations
  relationships between variables, how those relationships are different/similar when conditioned on other variables
  this is reconaissance  and an essential part of serious and deep data analysis.
  This involves enormous amounts of visualization.

Identify interesting aspects of data
Map the question to mathematical and statistical terms
  identify the randomness and how it arises
  What are the assumptions and scope of inference.
    What are the limitations of inference.
Consider how to model the data
  Identify different methods
  Consider the assumptions needed and how believable they are for the data.
    Determine how violating the assumptions  will change the qualitative results.
 
How can we perform the computations?


Visualize the results and interpret to answer the scientific/social question.

Statisticians often focus on the methods and do not necessarily appreciate the question being asked.
Scientists often focus on the problem and do not necessarily appreciate some of the subtleties of the methods. 

We hope to focus on both.
