* This class has several aims:
** practice data analysis 
*** not teach methods, but determine how to approach problems, identify relevant methods
*** focus on authentic data problems
** identify and foster a community of people doing data analysis/science
** discuss and use new statistical/machine learning methods
** solve computational challenges in authentic data analysis
** explore new data technologies


* Structure of the course
** The primary vehicle for the course are several data analyses.
*** We will discuss approaches to 
**** mapping the general questions to statistical frameworks
**** exploring data via visualization and summary statistics
**** identifying and evaluating competing statistical methods relevant to solving the problem
**** computational challenges and approaches for evaluating statistical methods
**** evaluating, comparing and interpreting the results of the statistical methods
**** mapping the results to the original questions
**** conveying the results

** Participants will work on one (or more) actual data analysis.

** We will propose two general analyses
*** Please feel free to propose and present others and attract people to work on that.

* Two Data Problems
** Classifying images as containing a CAT or a DOG
*** Kaggle competition
** Running and Cycling
*** Strava


** Other data sets proposed by participants
